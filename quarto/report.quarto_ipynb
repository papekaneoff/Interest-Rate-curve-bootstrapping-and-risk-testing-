        "  This project constructs and analyses the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve using bootstrapping techniques applied to market data obtained from FRED. We implement spline interpolation and Nelson–Siegel parametric fitting, derive forward and swap rates, and assess bond portfolio sensitivity through duration, convexity, and key rate measures. Stress testing and Monte Carlo VaR simulations are conducted to evaluate interest rate risk under various shock scenarios. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to historical yield curve movements to identify level, slope, and curvature factors. Finally, we extend the framework with a machine learning forecasting module. The project provides a fully reproducible quantitative fixed-income framework linking term structure modelling to practical risk management.\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n",
        "## 💡 Why does the yield curve matter?\n",
        "\n",
        "When you lend money for 1 year vs. 10 years, you expect a different return. The **yield curve** captures exactly that: how interest rates vary across maturities. Central banks, banks, insurers, and asset managers watch it daily, because it drives the price of virtually every financial instrument, from mortgages to derivatives.\n",
        ":::\n",
        "\n",
        "Interest rate modelling sits at the very heart of modern finance. Every bond, every swap, every mortgage-backed security, their values all depend fundamentally on one thing: the term structure of interest rates. This project tackles that problem head-on by building a complete framework for constructing, analysing, and stress-testing the U.S. Treasury yield curve.\n",
        "\n",
        "The motivation is straightforward. If you're managing a pension fund with billions in fixed-income assets, you need to know what happens when the Federal Reserve raises rates by 75 basis points. If you're an insurer with long-dated liabilities stretching 30 years into the future, you need to discount those cash flows at the right rate today, and understand how sensitive your balance sheet is to curve reshapings. If you're a derivatives desk pricing interest rate swaps, you need forward rates that are arbitrage-free and dynamically consistent with the spot curve.\n",
        "\n",
        "We start from the raw data published daily by the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) platform: Treasury yields at four key maturities (1Y, 2Y, 5Y, 10Y). From these four observable points, we reconstruct the full zero-coupon yield curve using bootstrapping, a recursive procedure that ensures no riskless arbitrage opportunities exist. We then fit smooth interpolation functions, both non-parametric (cubic splines) and parametric (Nelson–Siegel), allowing us to extract rates at any intermediate maturity needed for pricing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the curve is built, the real work begins: risk analysis. We compute duration and convexity to quantify first- and second-order sensitivities to parallel shifts. We stress-test the curve under extreme scenarios, parallel shocks, steepeners, flatteners, and measure portfolio value-at-risk using Monte Carlo simulation with 2 000 simulated interest rate paths. We decompose historical yield curve movements using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), isolating the three fundamental drivers of curve dynamics: level shifts, slope changes, and curvature adjustments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we push the framework one step further. Using the time series of daily yield changes we've already prepared for PCA, we build a machine learning forecasting module based on a Random Forest regressor. The model learns patterns in how short-term rates predict longer-term movements, giving us a simple but powerful tool for projecting the curve forward in time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The objective is clear:** build a reproducible, extensible quantitative framework that bridges textbook theory with the tools used daily by practitioners in asset management, banking, and actuarial science.\n",

        "## Literature Review\n",
        "\n",
        "The term structure of interest rates has been extensively studied in financial economics, with foundational work establishing both the theoretical basis for arbitrage-free pricing and empirical regularities in yield curve dynamics.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bootstrapping and arbitrage-free pricing.** The construction of zero-coupon curves from coupon-bearing instruments was formalized by McCulloch (1971) and Nelson and Siegel (1987), who introduced the parametric curve that bears their names. The bootstrapping procedure ensures consistency with the no-arbitrage condition: discount factors must be such that no combination of bonds can generate riskless profit (Jarrow 2009).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Yield curve factor structure.** Empirical research consistently finds that yield curve movements are driven by a small number of common factors. Litterman and Scheinkman (1991) applied Principal Component Analysis to U.S. Treasury yields and identified three dominant factors, level, slope, and curvature, which collectively explain over 95% of variation. This finding has been replicated across markets and time periods (Ang and Piazzesi 2003; Diebold and Li 2006).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Duration, convexity, and risk measures.** Macaulay (1938) introduced duration as a measure of interest rate sensitivity, later refined by Hicks (1939) into modified duration. Convexity, the second-order correction for non-linearity in the price-yield relationship, was developed to improve hedging strategies in volatile markets (Fabozzi 2007).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Machine learning in yield curve forecasting.** While traditional econometric models have dominated term structure forecasting (Diebold and Li 2006), recent work has explored machine learning approaches. Bianchi, Büchner, and Tamoni (2021) demonstrate that Random Forests can capture non-linear dependencies in rate dynamics, though they emphasize the challenge of non-stationarity and structural breaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "This literature provides the foundation for our analysis. Our contribution lies in integrating these components into a single, reproducible framework with modern computational tools (Quarto, Python, Plotly) suitable for both academic instruction and professional application.\n",

        "## Research Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "This project investigates how to construct, analyze, and manage interest rate risk using U.S. Treasury data. The analysis is guided by the following questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- How can we construct an arbitrage-free zero-coupon yield curve from observed market rates using bootstrapping?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- How much of yield curve variation is explained by level, slope, and curvature factors?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Can machine learning models successfully forecast short-term interest rate movements, or do structural breaks limit their usefulness?\n",

These aren't randomly chosen, they span the full term structure in a way that captures short-term monetary policy expectations (1Y), medium-term growth and inflation views (2Y, 5Y), and long-run equilibrium rates (10Y). Together, they give us enough anchor points to reconstruct the entire curve through interpolation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data runs from February 2021 through February 2026, giving us roughly 1 250 trading days, about five years of history. That's long enough to capture the full post-pandemic monetary policy cycle: the near-zero rate environment of 2021, the historic Fed hiking campaign of 2022–2023 (the fastest tightening cycle in four decades), and the stabilization phase we're living through now in early 2026. This period is particularly valuable for risk modelling because it includes both extreme volatility and quieter regimes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each CSV file from FRED arrives with two columns: `observation_date` and the ticker symbol (e.g., `DGS10` for the 10-year rate). We standardize these to `date` and `rate`, convert from percentage format (e.g., 3.45) to decimal (0.0345), and attach maturity labels. Any missing values, usually around federal holidays when the bond market is closed, are dropped. The result is a clean, tidy DataFrame ready for analysis."

The 1-year rate effectively tells us where the market thinks the Federal Funds rate will average over the next twelve months. The 10-year rate incorporates expectations about growth, inflation, and risk premiums stretching out to 2036. The slope between them, steepness or flatness, has historically been one of the best recession predictors: when the curve inverts (short rates above long rates), recessions tend to follow within 12–18 months. We're not inverted now, which is consistent with the consensus view that the U.S. economy is stabilizing rather than contracting.\n",

But a natural next question emerges: can we build a model that *predicts* where rates will be in 1 month, 3 months, or 6 months? Machine learning offers a data-driven approach to this problem.\n",

        "\n",
        "The idea is simple but powerful. Today's short-term rates often contain information about where longer-term rates are heading. If the 1-year rate jumps sharply, the 10-year rate tends to follow, though with a lag and a dampening effect. Machine learning can learn these patterns automatically from historical data, without requiring us to specify the functional form by hand.\n",

Random Forests are robust to overfitting, handle non-linear relationships naturally, and require minimal hyperparameter tuning. We train the model to predict the **1-month forward change** in the 10-year zero rate, using as features: (1) today's level of all four rates, (2) yesterday's changes in all four rates, and (3) the rolling 20-day volatility of rate changes."

        "# Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This project delivers a complete, reproducible framework for interest rate curve modelling and risk analysis. Starting from four observable Treasury yields published daily by FRED, we've built a zero-coupon curve, stress-tested it under extreme scenarios, decomposed historical movements into fundamental risk factors, and extended the toolkit with machine learning forecasting.\n",
        "\n",
        "The results reveal several key insights. First, the current U.S. yield curve is upward sloping (3.40% at 1Y, 4.16% at 10Y), reflecting a 76 basis point term premium, the market's compensation for inflation risk and uncertainty about future Fed policy. Second, our PCA analysis shows that 99.3% of yield curve variation over five years is explained by just three factors: level shifts, slope changes, and curvature adjustments. This is why professional risk managers focus on \"level-duration\" and \"slope-duration\", it's not simplification, it's empirical reality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Third, duration is the primary risk driver: a +100 bp parallel shock drops our portfolio value by roughly 4.5%, consistent with modified duration. But convexity matters too, the price-yield relationship is curved, not linear, meaning gains from rate falls exceed losses from rate rises by a margin that can be worth millions at institutional scale. Fourth, Monte Carlo VaR gives us the full loss distribution, not just a single number. We see the clustering around small moves, the fat left tail of severe downside scenarios, and the symmetric shape that validates our normal shock assumption.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the Random Forest forecasting module reveals an important lesson about machine learning in finance. Despite having proper infrastructure (PCA time series, clean data, feature engineering), the model failed to generalize to the test period (R² = -0.068), performing worse than a naive baseline. This failure demonstrates that historical patterns alone cannot capture regime shifts in non-stationary markets. The extension highlights both the potential of ML tools and the critical need to combine them with economic understanding and respect for structural breaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The framework is extensible. Natural next steps include adding more maturities (3M bills, 30Y bonds), incorporating credit spreads, building full term structure models (Vasicek, CIR, Hull-White), and feeding macro indicators into the ML module. But even as it stands, this is a production-ready toolkit. The code runs. The data is real. The methods are industry-standard.\n",
        "\n",
        "That's the goal of quantitative finance: turning abstract concepts, discount factors, eigenvalues, convexity, into tools that make better decisions. This project bridges that gap.\n",
